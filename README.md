# moonfire-tflite

This is a simple Rust wrapper around the [TensorFlow
Lite](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite) and
[edgetpu](https://github.com/google-coral/edgetpu) libraries, written by
Scott Lamb &lt;slamb@slamb.org>. It's primarily made to support video
analytics in [Moonfire NVR](https://github.com/scottlamb/moonfire-nvr).

As compared to the [tflite crate](https://crates.io/crates/tflite), advantages:

* Because it wraps the [C
  API](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/lite/c)
  rather than the C++ API, it's simpler and quicker to build. It doesn't need
  bindgen. (This is the primary reason I wrote my own.)
* It runs with a more modern version of TensorFlow, including the [specific
  commit](https://github.com/google-coral/edgetpu/issues/44#issuecomment-589170013)
  needed to work with the latest `edgetpu` library. (Adjusting to new
  TensorFlow version is much easier because of the simpler API.)
* It wraps the `edgetpu` library as well.

Disadvantages:

* It's much less mature: less usage, no documentation, no CI.
* It's less feature-rich; the C API can't do everything the C++ API can.
